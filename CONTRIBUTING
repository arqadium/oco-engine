Policies for Outside Contributions to Arqadium FOSS Projects



-----



1. ISSUE POLICY

- Before opening an issue, ensure it has not already been dealt with by
  searching the issues list on GitHub.
- Each issue must correspond to a single bug or feature request; do not stack
  issues in the GitHub repository.
- If possible, specify the platform(s) in question using labels.
- If the platform in question is PC-based and the issue is for a bug, note the
  specs of the PC in question.
- If filing for a bug, specify the steps involved in reproducing it.
- If filing for a bug, a simple code snippet that reproduces it is preferred.



2. PULL REQUEST POLICY

- Communicate with the developer core about the PR to prevent wasted effort
  on undesired contributions. Arqadium offers a Discord guild to this end, at
  <https://discord.gg/VbJAsHX>. There is also a company IRC server at
  "irc.arqadium.com:666{0-9}" (port 6697 for SSL), and a free webchat modal at
  <https://chat.arqadium.com/>.
- If the PR mitigates or solves an issue, reference that issue by number in
  the commit log.
